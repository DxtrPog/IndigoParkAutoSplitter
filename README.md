# Indigo Park Autosplitter

## Installation
### This is not important if you got this off LiveSplit directly (currently not possible)
If you are downloading this on GitHub, press the green "Code" button at the top of the page and press "Download ZIP" 

Once you have downloaded it extract the zip somewhere that you will remember

Once extracted go into LiveSplit right click on the LiveSplit window and click "Edit Layout"

Press the + button on the side go down to "Control" and click "Scriptable Auto Splitter"

Click on browse and find where you extracted the file and double click it.

## Usage
Once downloaded you should see options (if you downloaded it directly it will be in your layout settings)

Select the options according to where you want it to split, so if you do not select Park Entrance, but select Railroad Tunnel it will split at the end of Railroad Tunnel.

Now you want to make sure that it is comparing against Game Time, to do this right click on your LiveSplit window, hover over "Compare Against" and select "Game Time"

## Settings
**Park Entrance:** Park Entrance is the whole starting are, meaning this splits at the loading zone that goes into the tunnel before railroad

**Railroad Tunnel:** Railroad Tunnel is the area before you go onto the train.

**Rambleys Railroad:** This split is for the entire train segment, from the start of the train to the area with Jetstream Junction and Lloyd's Theater

**Main Street:** This enables two splits, one after the Train Ride and one after Lloyd's Theater.

**Theater:** This is Lloyds area and the area where you have to grab the key.

**Jetstream Junction:** This is the area before you enter the Puzzle/Ballpit room.

**Chase Scene/Mollies Area:** this is the part where Mollie chases you through the playplace/playground.

**Road to Ocean:** This is the end of the game and is needed to be on if you are ending your time at the end of the game
